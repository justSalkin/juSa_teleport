# juSa_teleport

A script that allows you to add different teleporters to your server. <br>
You can create normal teleporters, hidden teleporters or one-way teleporters.

Features:
- set blips for your teleporters
- set jobs (one or more) which are allowed to use the teleporter
- set items that are required to use the teleporter
- decide whether the item is consumed in the process
- decide whether your teleporter should be visible or hidden
- determine whether your teleporter should only be usable in one direction
- translate the script directly in config.lua
- set a distance at which teleporters are loaded (saves resources)
